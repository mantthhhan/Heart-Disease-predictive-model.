# Heart-Disease-predictive-model.
I have a dataset that contains information about patients, including various features that determine whether they have heart disease or not. 
My objective is to develop a predictive model that can classify patients based on their likelihood of having heart disease. 

To achieve this, I will use the logistic regression classification algorithm, which is well-suited for binary classification problems like this.

By training the model on this data, I aim to improve the accuracy of predictions and potentially provide insights into the key factors contributing to heart disease.
